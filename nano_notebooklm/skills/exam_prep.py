"""Exam Prep — closed-loop, self-evolving exam preparation skill.

State machine persisted at `artifacts/courses/<id>/exam_bank.json`:

  Phase 1 — plan_topics:
    Extract 5–8 exam-focused topics from the course KB. Each topic has
    a name, weight (0–1), seed source_chunks, and an empty questions
    list. Stable `topic_id = sha1(name)[:10]`.

  Phase 2 — seed_questions / on-demand:
    Per topic, generate diverse multi-type questions (multiple_choice +
    short_answer). Triggered explicitly via action=seed or implicitly on
    the first `next_quiz` for unseeded topics.

  Phase 3 — next_quiz / submit:
    Sample non-mastered questions weighted by topic.weight × wrong-rate.
    On submit, wrong-answered topics trigger LLM variant generation —
    same topic, fresh angle, appended with `variant_of` provenance.

Mastery (per-question): consecutive_correct ≥ MASTERED_THRESHOLD (=3) →
mastered=True, excluded from future quizzes. Reset on any wrong answer.
Topic mastery: ≥ TOPIC_MASTERY_RATIO (0.8) of questions mastered AND
total ≥ TOPIC_MASTERY_MIN_QUESTIONS (3).

Variant budget per submit: `min(PER_TOPIC_CAP=5, max(1, TOTAL_CAP=20 //
wrong_topic_count))` so a single-topic miss can't burn 20 LLM calls and
many-topic misses still get at least one variant each.
